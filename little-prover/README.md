## weird stuff

From [https://github.com/juxtin/clj-bob/blob/master/README.md#weird-stuff](https://github.com/juxtin/clj-bob/blob/master/README.md#weird-stuff):

> The book/J-Bob assume that `.` and `/` are legal to use in function names.
>
> Unfortunately, Clojure disagrees.
>
> Through the use of advanced search-and-replaceâ„¢ technology, I changed all `.`s and `/`s into `-`.
>
> That means that `chapter1.example1` is now `chapter1-example1`, `dethm.set?/sub` is now `dethm-set?-sub`, etc.
